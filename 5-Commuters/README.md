# Commuters analysis

Methods developped by Marianne GuÃ©rois & Laurent Beauguitte.

The statmat function provides for a source origin matrix a certain number of useful elements for knowing the initial data but also statistically justifying the method or the selected threshold. We obtain in particular the total volume of flows and the basic statistical indicators on these flows (quartiles, average, etc.), the density, the number, the size and the composition of the related components, the weighted and unweighted degree of the vertices. Graphical outputs are used to study the distribution of degrees (weighted and unweighted) and links (mustache box and Lorenz curve on the intensity of flows).

With regard to selection, three families of methods are implemented:

- classic dominant flows
- local criteria (for each summit, keep the flows satisfying such criteria)
- global criteria (considering all flows, keep those satisfying such criteria).

In our methods, we choose global criterion to analyse the most used paths.

- Flow selection from Origins: above the median
- DominantFlows selects which flow (fij or fji) must be kept. If the ratio weight of destination (wj) / weight of origin (wi) is greater than 1.
